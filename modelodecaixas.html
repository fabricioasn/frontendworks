        <h2 class="titulo"> This Week in NASA History: Hi-C Launches – July 11, 2012  </h2>
           <p>This week in 2012, the first High Resolution Coronal Imager, or Hi-C, successfully launched aboard a sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The innovative suborbital telescope was designed to capture the highest-resolution images ever taken of the million-and-a-half-degree solar corona, resulting in images that revealed previously unseen magnetic activity. The Hi-C experiment was led by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in partnership with the University of Alabama at Huntsville, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the University of Central Lancashire in Lancashire, England, and the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The NASA History Program is responsible for generating, disseminating, and preserving NASA’s remarkable history and providing a comprehensive understanding of the institutional, cultural, social, political, economic, technological, and scientific aspects of NASA’s activities in aeronautics and space.
